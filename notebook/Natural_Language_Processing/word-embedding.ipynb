    "Word2Vec is a neural approach for generating word embeddings. It belongs to the family of neural word embedding techniques and specifically falls under the category of distributed representation models. It is a popular technique in natural language processing (NLP) that is used to represent words as continuous vector spaces. Developed by a team at Google, Word2Vec aims to capture the semantic relationships between words by mapping them to high-dimensional vectors. The underlying idea is that words with similar meanings should have similar vector representations. In Word2Vec every word is assigned a vector. We start with either a random vector or one-hot vector."
